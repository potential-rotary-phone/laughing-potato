Iterate over the sorted positions
Get the index of the current robot based on its position
Check the direction of the current robot If the robot is moving to the right, push its index onto the stack
If the robot is moving to the left, handle potential collisions
Handle collisions: Get the last robot moving to the right and determine the outcome of the collision:
If the current robot survives, decrease its health.
If the right-moving robot survives, do the same thing and re-add the right-moving robot to the stack for potential further collisions.
If both have the same health, both will be removed.
