Reimplementation of min method: First, we'll raise an exception called Empty if the priority queue is empty. If it's not empty, we'll return the smallest item, which is located at the front of the list.
Reimplementation of remove_min method: Similar to the min method, we'll start by raising an Empty exception if the priority queue is empty. If the queue is not empty, we'll remove the smallest item from the front of the list. After removing it, we'll return the key-value pair of the removed item. The time complexity of the remove_min method is O(1) for removing the minimum element from the priority queue. This is because the method simply removes the first element from the list, which can be done in constant time. The space complexity of the remove_min method is O(1) as well. This is because the method only removes one element from the list and does not create any additional data structures that grow with the input size.
